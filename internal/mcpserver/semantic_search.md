# Claude Context Search

Use claude-context for conceptual discovery across a repo. Use native grep,
ripgrep, or direct file reads for exact literals, exact line references,
exhaustive occurrence lists, or when semantic results stay low-signal after one
corrective pass.

## Workflow

1. Call get_indexing_status on the absolute repository root before searching.
2. If get_indexing_status returns "not indexed", stop immediately, ask the user
   whether to index the codebase, and wait for an explicit yes before calling
   index_codebase. Do not index without permission.
3. If indexing is still in progress, treat results as provisional and wait for
   completed before trusting ranking.
4. Look at the reported file and chunk counts. If the index is roughly one
   chunk per file, treat it as coarse and expect noisy whole-file matches.
5. Phrase the query as natural-language intent.
6. For implementation questions, pass an extensionFilter array for real source
   files such as [".go"], [".swift"], [".ts"], or [".py"]. Do not search docs
   first unless the user is asking about docs.
7. Read the first results skeptically. Hits in README.md, AGENTS.md, *.pb.go,
   *.grpc.pb.go, or other generated files are warning signs, not answers.
8. If results are coarse, retry once with a tighter extensionFilter and a
   higher limit.
9. If results are still dominated by docs or generated files, stop using
   semantic search for that question and switch to native grep or ripgrep
   instead of repeatedly forcing semantic search.
10. Reindex only when needed and only with user permission. Use splitter: ast
    by default. Use splitter: langchain only as a user-approved diagnostic,
    since it can still produce one-chunk-per-file indexes or reduce coverage.
11. If the existing index is coarse (roughly one chunk per file) and the user
    wants finer-grained results, call index_codebase again with the desired
    splitter (typically ast). The daemon replaces chunks file by file through
    a streaming reindex, so the existing index keeps returning ranked results
    throughout the upgrade. You do not need to clear the index first, and you
    do not need force=true unless a job is already in flight with a
    different config.
12. Treat returned chunks as candidates. Read the cited files before acting
    because the working tree can be newer than the index.

## Subagent Instructions

When launching Task subagents, include this guidance verbatim after
substituting the absolute repository root for <path>:

Use the claude-context MCP search_code tool first for conceptual code discovery
in <path>. Call get_indexing_status before searching. If the status is "not
indexed", stop, ask the user for permission to index, and wait for an explicit
yes before calling index_codebase. Do not index without permission. Do not
trust rankings while indexing is still in progress. If the reported stats are
roughly one chunk per file, treat the index as coarse. For implementation
questions, pass an extensionFilter array for the source language, e.g. [".go"].
If the top hits
are docs like README.md or generated files like *.pb.go, retry once with
tighter filters and a higher limit, then fall back to native grep or ripgrep
instead of repeatedly forcing semantic search. Use splitter: ast by default
when reindexing, and use splitter: langchain only when the user explicitly
wants that diagnostic.

## Tool Reference

Every path argument is named `absolutePath` and must be an absolute path. Array
arguments are JSON arrays of strings, for example `[".go", ".ts"]`, not a
comma-separated string.

- search_code(absolutePath: string, query: string, limit?: number,
  extensionFilter?: string[]) returns ranked chunks. `extensionFilter` is a JSON
  array of extensions like `[".go"]`; omit it or pass `[]` to search all files.
- get_indexing_status(absolutePath: string) reports status and file or chunk
  counts.
- index_codebase(absolutePath: string, force?: boolean, splitter?: string,
  ignorePatterns?: string[], wait?: boolean,
  wait_timeout_seconds?: number) bootstraps the index when the codebase is not
  tracked, or runs a streaming reindex against the existing Milvus collection
  when the codebase is already indexed with a different config or when
  force=true. The streaming path replaces chunks file by file so search results
  stay available throughout the upgrade. `ignorePatterns` is a string array of
  extra ignore patterns to exclude. When `wait` is true the call blocks until the
  job reaches a terminal state or `wait_timeout_seconds` (default 300) elapses,
  after which it returns current progress while the job keeps running.
- clear_index(absolutePath: string) removes the index and should only be used
  when the user explicitly wants a full wipe.
