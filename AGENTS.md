# AGENTS

Durable instructions for coding agents working in this repository.

Keep this file short, current, and focused on rules that should affect day-to-day code changes. Move long runbooks, dated audits, generated examples, and machine-specific workflows into `docs/` if they ever appear.

## Project purpose

`claude-context-go` is a ground-up Go rewrite of `zilliztech/claude-context`. The repo owns three binaries: the long-lived `claude-contextd` daemon, the `claude-context` operator CLI, and the `claude-context-mcp` stdio adapter. VS Code and Chrome extension clients are intentionally out of scope here. The Go port is independent of and not affiliated with Zilliz; the `io.zilliz.claude-contextd` launchd label is kept only for drop-in service compatibility with the upstream daemon.

## Transport contract

The daemon transport is gRPC only, with protobuf definitions managed by `buf`. The repo does not define or accept a JSON-RPC control plane.

Sources of truth:

- `proto/claudecontext/v1/service.proto`
- `buf.yaml`
- `buf.gen.yaml`

## TS upstream drop-in compatibility

The Go daemon must work as a drop-in replacement for the upstream TS adapter, without any migration step. `~/.context/mcp-codebase-snapshot.json` and `~/.context/merkle/<md5(path)>.json` are treated as a read-only fallback view. The mechanism lives in `internal/migrate/snapshot.go` (`LoadSnapshot`, `SynthesizeCodebase`) and `internal/daemon/manager.go` (`resolveFromLegacySnapshot`).

Rules:

- Both adapters compute the same Milvus collection name `hybrid_code_chunks_<md5(path)[:8]>`, so the actual embedded data is already shared. Code that constructs collection names must keep this invariant.
- The Go registry stays the write source for any codebase the Go daemon owns. Synthesized records from the TS snapshot are never persisted and never appear in `manager.codebases`, so background sync cannot accidentally pick them up and re-embed.
- Do not add any one-shot or recurring import that copies TS state into the Go registry. The user explicitly rejected import semantics in favor of read-through.

## Embedding

The Go port supports exactly one embedding provider, an OpenAI-compatible HTTP adapter. `OPENAI_BASE_URL` points at any endpoint that speaks the OpenAI embeddings API.

Rules:

- Do not add provider-specific clients for VoyageAI, Gemini, or native Ollama. Anything that speaks OpenAI on a configurable base URL works without code changes.
- Do not assume an internet connection. Default config should let `claude-context-mcp` start and answer "not indexed" gracefully even when the embedding endpoint is unreachable.

## Splitter

- AST (default): `tree-sitter` parsers for JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Java, C, C++, Go, Rust, Scala, and C#. Chunks fall on class, function, method, and interface declarations.
- `langchain` (opt-in via `splitter: "langchain"` per index request): a recursive separator splitter that mirrors LangChain JS `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter.fromLanguage`. Per-language separator tables live in `internal/splitter/langchain.go` for js, python, java, cpp, go, rust, php, ruby, swift, scala, html, markdown, latex, and sol.

Treat `langchain` as a fallback diagnostic, not a default. AST chunks produce dramatically better search results.

## Incremental sync

Per-codebase Merkle snapshots live under `~/.contextd/merkle/<codebase-id>.json`. The sync flow lives in `internal/daemon/background_sync.go` and `internal/daemon/manager.go` (`runDeltaSync`).

On every sync request:

1. The daemon captures a new snapshot of the codebase.
2. `merkle.DiffSnapshots` computes `{Added, Modified, Removed}`.
3. An empty diff completes the job as a no-op tagged "already up to date".
4. The indexer otherwise processes only added and modified files, and `semantic.Reindex` deletes existing Milvus rows for `relative_path in (removed + modified)` before upserting the new chunks.
5. The new snapshot is persisted only after success.

A missing previous snapshot or a missing semantic collection routes back to a full `Replace`.

## Idempotency

Concurrent MCP requests for the same codebase deduplicate against any in-flight job with a matching effective config, and that includes `force=true` requests. N parallel `index_codebase(force=true)` calls collapse to a single embedding pass instead of cancelling each other in sequence. This defensive shape prevents the machine-blowing-up failure mode where a client fan-out can otherwise launch arbitrary parallel work.

The mechanism is `Manager.dedupAgainstActiveJob` in `internal/daemon/manager.go`. Do not regress this contract when touching `StartIndex` or the job lifecycle.

## Blocking `index_codebase`

The MCP tool accepts `wait: true` and `wait_timeout_seconds` (default 300). When `wait=true`, the handler in `internal/mcpserver/server.go` polls `GetJob` every 1.5 seconds until the job reaches `completed`, `failed`, or `cancelled`, then returns the corresponding `GetIndex` response. On timeout the daemon job keeps running and the tool returns the latest progress.

Rules:

- When `wait=true`, always poll through the daemon. Do not subscribe directly to manager state.
- Concurrent waiters dedupe at the daemon's StartIndex path, so adding extra retry logic in the MCP handler is unnecessary.

## Orphan guard

The MCP adapter must exit when its parent process (Claude Code, Cursor, an editor) exits. Three independent defenses make sure that happens:

1. **stdin EOF**: the parent closes its end of the pipe, the read loop returns, and the process unwinds.
2. **PPID watcher**: `internal/mcpserver/orphan_guard.go` polls `os.Getppid()` every 2 seconds and cancels the run context when it returns `1` (reparented to init).
3. **Panic recovery**: `cmd/claude-context-mcp/main.go` wraps `mcpserver.Run` in a deferred recover that forces `os.Exit(1)` so a panic in any goroutine takes the whole process down rather than leaving a half-dead orphan.

`make kill-orphans` is the only sanctioned cleanup tool. The Makefile target checks `PPID == 1` and leaves live adapters with real parents untouched. Never run `pkill -9 -f "claude-context-mcp"` or any equivalent broad pattern match; the pattern matches every running adapter on the host and disconnects active sessions.

## Time and timezone

The daemon stores every timestamp in UTC (see `internal/clock/clock.go`). Human-facing MCP and CLI output renders timestamps in the daemon host's local time zone with the abbreviation appended, through `formatLocalTime` in `internal/daemon/render.go`. Machine-facing JSON output preserves UTC via `protojson` so consumers can parse with RFC3339.

When adding new timestamp output, use `formatLocalTime` for any string headed at a human-facing display path. Anything that flows into JSON or the gRPC wire should stay UTC.

## Style and structural conventions

JavaScript and TypeScript style does not apply here; this is Go.

- Top-level functions declared with `func`, not assigned to variables.
- Every function, method, parameter, and return type has a concrete Go type. Avoid `any` and `interface{}` unless a real upstream union requires it.
- Test files live alongside the package source.
- Wrap errors with operation context and the relevant identifier.
- Add package doc comments and exported type comments. Add field comments only when the field's meaning is not obvious from its name.
- Match the existing comment density. The codebase favors comments on the why, not the what.

## Testing and verification

Run all of the following before claiming a change is complete:

- `go test ./...`
- `make lint` (golangci-lint, gofumpt, gocyclo, deadcode, staticcheck-extra; all five gates must pass)
- `make build` (also runs vet and govulncheck)
- For changes that touch the live indexing path, run a live smoke against the user's local Milvus and `lmd-serve` on port 5400.

### Failing make steps

If any `make` step fails, fix the underlying code, test, configuration, or documentation honestly. Do not disable, silence, weaken, baseline, or otherwise circumvent the check. Do not add `|| true`, ignore exit codes, narrow target scopes, raise thresholds, or remove checks unless the user explicitly asks for that exact policy change.

## Deliberately not supported

The Go port is local- and self-hosted-only. The following upstream surfaces are intentionally absent:

- Zilliz Cloud auto-provisioning, `ClusterManager`, free-cluster creation.
- `checkCollectionLimit()` and the Zilliz pricing surface.
- `syncIndexedCodebasesFromCloud()` and description-based recovery.
- `MILVUS_TOKEN`-based address auto-resolution.
- The `MilvusRestfulVectorDatabase` REST client.
- VS Code and Chrome extension packages.
- Telemetry and hosted-service hooks.
- Dedicated VoyageAI, Gemini, and Ollama embedding clients. Use an OpenAI-compatible proxy with `OPENAI_BASE_URL` instead.
